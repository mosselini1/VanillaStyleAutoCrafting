My take on an implementation of an autocrafter in a vanilla minecraft style

Machine Info:


How to use the machine:
***********************

1) Go to the input pad (33, -34, 4)

2) Place your recipe inside the dropper:
   - max 1 element per slot
   - if your recipe contains empty spots please use (dry) sponges as filler

3) Make sure all spots are filled then stand back and press the button.

4) Go to the output pad (7, -50, 5) and wait for your items to arrive, the sponge filler will be returned as well

Once the light goes back on and the dropper isn't blocked you can input again

Machine circuit explanation:
****************************

Global idea: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) INPUT craft recipe with filler items 
2) send one by one to autocrafter
3) remove the filler items
4) craft
5) flush/drain all the items from the crafter and the filter hopper
6) OUTPUT
7) refill the filter hopper

Colour explanation for sub-circuits:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- jungle planks: once button pushed, disengages the circuit to disallow more pushes [state]

- black wool: pulse extenders

- smooth stone: make input less noisy when not needed

- birch planks: make input less prone to errors by blocking input while working and display light when not [state]

- sandstone: slow down the intake of items (hopper)

- iron blocks: separate filler and non filler items

- red sandstone: count number of filler items and store this amount

- yellow wool: item filter (design seen in NimsTV Youtube video "Compact Item Filter - Minecraft: Tutorial") 

- white wool: automatic container emptying (design seen in Cubehamster Youtube video "Auto Dispenser/Dropper - Fully Automatic - No Clicking Noises in Minecraft") 

- orange wool: item holding cells (1 item per cell)

- green wool: toggle state denoting all the holding cells being full [state]

- light gray wool: send signal to generate as much pulses as filter items previously counted [state]

- lime wool: timer (design seen in Dataless822 Youtube video "Minecraft Adjustable Hopper Time Tutorial") 

- purple wool: detection system for the case when there is no filler [state]

- prismarine bricks: follow up of purple wool, will activate filter re-creation [state]

- dark blue wool: disengage holding cells circuits

- light blue wool: holding cell hopper lock

- dark blue wool + light blue wool: let held items free

- cyan wool: filer pulses transport to crafter

- lime concrete: connect timers together

- terracota: signal to autocrafter to craft

- oak planks: launches the flush of the crafter and the filter from all items [state]

- stone bricks: the flush circuit

- acacia planks: ends the flush (flush till no items left) by breaking the circuit [state]

- brown wool: pulse duplication

- red wool: state circuits resets

- end stone: manages holding cell for filler items [state]

- gray wool: stop locking hoppers for filter filters (signs) [state]

For more details about the circuit please go check out the diagram provided with the mod

Oddities:
~~~~~~~~~
The main filter item is sponge but there is a need for a filter of filters
-> 4 different signs are used (can't be the same otherwise they would stack)
(there is a filter for filler items -> there are filler elements for the filler item)

Hoppers are covered in blackstone to avoid unnecessary contamination of their insides (and lag)

There is an error chest, nothing should ever get into it, otherwise it means that the holding cells have a problem.

Other:
~~~~~~~~~
2 pistons facing each other, 2 spaces apart and pushing around a block is what i call a state switcher (on/off signal)
in the colour explanation it is mentioned as [state]

The golden areas are the INPUT/OUTPUT
The diamond block is the world spawn
